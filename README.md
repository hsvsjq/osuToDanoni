osu file to danoni data


tutorial: 

  run dist/meow.exe 
  
  insert the osu file path (without quotes)
  
  insert id if you'll be putting more than one chart on the same file
  
  - for the first chart id is empty, for the second "2"(without quotes), the third "3"(without quotes) and so on 
    
  in col names insert the values of your key's charaN values
  
  - one per column 
  - be careful
  --  insert exactly the osu key count number of columns
  --  be sure that the name is exactly the charaN value (with no spaces after or before)
  - if you want to add more charaN values (for custom keys or something)
  --  make sure you add the Freeze name on the dist/frz_names.csv file
